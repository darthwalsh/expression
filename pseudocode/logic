To test the calculator:
Open the text file "test.txt" in the parent folder.
Splitting the file by line, do this for every group of three lines:
  Parse and evaluate the first line.
  That's expected to be the same as whatever's after the first char of the second line.
  If they're different, output an error and quit.

To Parse a line:
  Reading in as many as characters a possible, produce an expression tree from 
    If there are one or more characters 0 to 9 (optionally preceded by a negative symbol),
      Constants Expression, from parsing the digits as an integer
    If there are one of the arithmatic operators + - * / ^ %
      Binary Expression, parsing the left expression then the right expression.
  If there are still symbols left over, there was a problem parsing.

To Evaluate an expression:
  A Constant Expression evaluates to the number it was created with.
  A Binary Expression evalutes by evaluating the left and the right side, then for:
    + take the sum
    - take the difference
    * take the product
    / take the quotient
    ^ take the power
    % take the modulo
