# Expresion

Implementations of a simple calculator app using different programming languages.

For more details for how a program is expected to work, look at [pseudocode/logic].

For running test cases or writing code, Visual Studio Code has build/test rules set up.

## Language

A line like `+ 1 2` means add 1 and 2.
Instead of infix notation (the normal way of writing math like `1 + 2 * 3`) the caculator uses prefix (i.e. `* + 1 2 3`).
If instead you want `(1 + 2) * 3` then in prefix that's `

## Tests

Each program has a test runner.
The test cases are in [test.txt]. One line with have the test inputs.
The next line has the expected answer.
